# Map-Extraction-for-Next-Generation-Gaming
Prototype for a unde-rgraduation thesis "Map Extraction for Next Generation Gaming". It extracts road skeleton from satellite images and apply it to a movement operation. Which can be used as a basic operation for a game. 

These operations are performed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and OpenCV2 version.
These are 21 examples of 21 images, from which road skeleton are extracted and used for a movement operation.

The corresponding image of each folder is the input image. Put it into the  directory of your Visual Studio project.
The code will create an output image named as output.JPG in the same directory and will run the basic movement operation instantly.
